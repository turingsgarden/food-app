Since the hidden ingredients aren't visible, we can only speculate based on common practices in preparing beef nachos.  Quantities are estimates and will vary based on recipe preference.

**Likely Hidden Ingredients:**

* **Vegetable Oil or Canola Oil:** 1-2 tablespoons (for cooking the ground beef)
* **Taco Seasoning:** 1-2 tablespoons (a pre-made blend or a homemade mix of chili powder, cumin, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, salt, and pepper)
* **Salt:** To taste (likely added to the beef during cooking)
* **Black Pepper:** To taste (likely added to the beef during cooking)
* **Onions:** 1/4 - 1/2 small onion, finely chopped (often sautéed with the beef for flavor)
* **Garlic:** 1-2 cloves, minced (often sautéed with the beef and onions for flavor)
* **Water or Beef Broth:** 1-2 tablespoons (possibly added to the beef during cooking to prevent dryness)
* **Shredded Cheese:** A small amount under the melted cheddar cheese (Many recipes use a blend to ensure even melting and flavor.)


**Note:**  The guacamole in the side bowl is *not* considered a hidden ingredient of the nachos themselves, even though it's meant to be eaten with them.
